# HitOrNotClassificationProject
---

Regardless of what is going on in the world, music is one force that will always unite us. From the lullabies our mothers use to sing us to sleep to the hymns that play at our funerals, there is almost not a day that goes by without me hearing the sound of music. Although the music we listen to has grown with time, the way in which it is made has not. All it takes is some creative people, a couple of instruments, and the rawness of emotion - but can this all be taken away? 
Can a machine mimic what is known to be one of the greatest creations of humans? Can an algorithm predict whether a song will be a hit before it even reaches the ears of consumers? In fact, before a song is even made? Can artists use machine learning when making music to ensure their music will be more likable by consumers?
These are just a couple of questions that I hope to delve deeper into by analyzing a dataset of my favorite era of music - the early 2000s. In this notebook, I will I created a classification model using machine learning to accurately predict what I call the "Hitability" of a song - whether or not a song will be considered a hit or not in the music industry.
